## How to report a bug

If you find a security vulnerability, do **NOT** open an issue.
Email [eoin@videtur.io](mailto:eoin@videtur.io) instead.

When opening up a bug report or general issue, please use the issue template provided.

## How to suggest a feature or enhancement

This is by nature a small plugin project, so the scope for added features is quite small.
The philosophy here is to do one thing, that is, optimistic concurrency control for mongoose, and to do it well.
That being said, suggestions for enhancement or improvement are always welcome.

When suggesting a new feature or enhancement, create an issue and tag it as such.
Make sure to use the template provided in GitHub.
Scope out the feature when proposing it, and explain the rationale behind it.
Give an example of how it could be used, if applicable.
